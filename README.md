# What is RilvX?

RilvX is a new way to develop authentication systems. Products ranging from videogames to cloud services can integrate our infastructure. Once an account is created with us, you create your central profile, and as many sub-profiles as wanted. RilvX can be used to sign in to a web application using a browser extension or desktop application, or with a mobile app. Just by pressing "authenticate," you are signed into to the third party application without the need for an email or password. Every application you have authenticated with can be managed through the RilvX dashboard, from account deletion to profiles. Your central profile is uploaded and synced onto every application you have authenticated with, which means editing your central profile with RilvX instantly deploys the changes to every selected app. RilvX also allows for multiple profiles, and each profile can be deployed to specific apps.

In addition to authentication, RilvX comes with a suite of extra features. Here's a full list:

RilvX Auth: Authenticate with any app using RilvX.

RilvX Cloud: A suite of enterprise products, from hosting, databases, to our authentication API. 

RilvX IDE: A browser and desktop supported advanced IDE,
